# Chen_Gutstein_Swarup_Tenesaca_project
The jupyter notebook was created using Google Colab, so there may be some commands and specific file paths may need to be changed before running the code. 

# Running main.ipynb
main.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file that contains the the code for setting up the relational database, goal 1, and goal 3. 
The zipped files are the parquet files for each survey data, and they are to be mounted in the specificed "data_path". 
Step 0.2 does not be run as if the files are mounted correctly, they should be read in Step 0.3. 

# Running linear_affordability_checker.py and rf_affordability_checker.py
These two .py files contain the code to run the program for goal 2. 
Ensure that the zipped files containing the parquet files are in the same directory as the .py files.
